    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>I received my bachelor's degree in English education in 2007 and a master’s degree in English Culture Studies with a focus on <em>Australia</em> in 2012. In the same year, I left China and came to the United States for my master's degree in teaching and curriculum at <em>Michigan State University</em>. Now I am pursuing my educational specialist in technology degree at University of Missouri – Columbia with a focus on technology in schools. I am hoping to complete my study and receive my <strong>degree</strong> in 2024. <br/>I currently hold Michigan Professional Teaching Certificate and I am certified to teach Chinese language and culture to k-12 students. I am also studying for my Google certificate in IT support. </p>
