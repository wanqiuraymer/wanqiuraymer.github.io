            <h1 id="part1" class="h2"> Who do you have in your family?</h1>
            <p>
                Students will be able to describe who they have in their family in speaking and writing forms.<br/>
                Family is a very important part of Chinese culture. In this section, we will learn about the family members (vocabulary) and how to describe your family (sentences and paragraphs) in both speaking and writing forms. A typical Chinese family includes parents, children, and sometimes grandparents.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJoPWNBjjA"> Here</a> (Artifact 1) is a video for you to get to know families in China. Pay special attention to brothers and sisters. We have four specific terms for the four siblings! This section is mainly focused on immediate family and grandparents. We will also learn how to write the language content in Chinese characters. When you are practicing writing characters, the stroke order is very important. That’s how we avoid skipping strokes or parts. Use <a href="https://www.archchinese.com/g.html?g=498d1c3f8ebc58j308897b38bc1b543d5a97">this game </a> (Artifact 2) to help you practice.

        <div class="box1">
            <h1 id="part2" class="h2"> How many siblings?</h1>
            <p >
            Students will be able to state how many siblings they have and inquire their classmates about the topic. <br/>
            In this section, you will learn about a very important concept – measure words. Even though there are measure words in English for uncountable nouns, they are used a lot more often in Chinese. We are going to learn the use of the most widely used measure word “个(gè)” in describing how many siblings you have. Read <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15WKYDvZmd8GLCTH0977lEM5pBlTA0k0V/view">this material</a> (Artifact 3) to get an idea first. After you know how to describe the siblings you have or (don’t have), we are going to ask our classmates about their siblings. Here, we are going to learn a new question word “几(jǐ)”. This question word is used to ask about numbers, usually small numbers (smaller than 10). We will use this question to ask how many siblings our classmates have in questions like “你有几个哥哥？”

        <p id="pgoal3" >
            Students will be able to compare US families and Chinese families. <br/>
            After learning about families, do you think US families and Chinese families are the same or different? Or maybe they have both similarities and differences, and it is hard to cover everything in just one sentence. Then, let’s talk about it! Read <a href= "https://drive.google.com/file/d/11DdPULRxd415tQl_eIn9i7kG1M-mFE4O/view">this material</a> (Artifact 4) to supplement your knowledge of Chinese families. Below are some questions to think about while you read. After you read, let’s compare families in the US and in China. You can show us your conclusion in a diagram or a chart. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>How do they address their siblings? Directly by their names?</li>
                <li>Do grandparents live with them?</li>
                <li>What about pets? Do a lot of families have pets? Do they consider pets as family members?</li>
                <li>How about the family size? Does it stay the same over the years or not? If not, what’s the trend? </li>
            </ul>

            Now, let’s check your understanding. <br/>
            First, use <a href="https://www.archchinese.com/g.html?g=18275bfe82c938jbc9891a5840411592ad3c">this game</a> (Artifact 5) to see how well you know the language content. Then, form a playhouse family with your classmates and introduce it to your class. Here is <a href="https://view.genial.ly/618e6ff8e6be9e0d3ece296e/presentation-play-house-instruction">the instruction</a> (Artifact 6). Last, write about your family in <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-gUIFz1msBIVbALBwF5JJVrjmWgKlJNI/view">this writing sheet</a> (Artifact 7).
