                Students will be able to describe who they have in their family in speaking and writing forms.<br/>
                Family is a very important part of Chinese culture. In this section, we will learn about the family members (vocabulary) and how to describe your family (sentences and paragraphs) in both speaking and writing forms. A typical Chinese family includes parents, children, and sometimes grandparents.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLJoPWNBjjA"> Here</a> (Artifact 1) is a video for you to get to know families in China. Pay special attention to brothers and sisters. We have four specific terms for the four siblings! This section is mainly focused on immediate family and grandparents. We will also learn how to write the language content in Chinese characters. When you are practicing writing characters, the stroke order is very important. Thatâ€™s how we avoid skipping strokes or parts. Use <a href="https://www.archchinese.com/g.html?g=498d1c3f8ebc58j308897b38bc1b543d5a97">this game </a> (Artifact 2) to help you practice.
